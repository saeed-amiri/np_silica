"""make water box with packmmol
Preparing and running input file for packmol
It needs the Radius of the NP, also the size of the box, and number of
water molecules,
The output file has such a structure:

    tolerance TOLERANCE
    structure INPUT.FILE
       number NUMBER__OF_WATER_MOLECULES
       inside box X_MIN Y_MIN Z_MIN X_MAX Y_MAX Z_MAX
       outside sphere 0. 0. 0. NP_RADIUS+1
    end structure

output OUTPUT.FILE

The script kept the input file format as the standard PACKMOL PDB
input file for water.
The script first makes a PDB file, then converts it to the standard PDB
and data file structure.


The maximum radius is from silanized data.
TOLERANCE, X, Y, and Z limitations are from the "statinfo" module.
The number of molecules should be calculated from the final volume of
the water box based on the limitations.
